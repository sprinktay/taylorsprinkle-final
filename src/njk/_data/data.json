      "text": "<p>Les, who formerly released music under the moniker osno1, calls the duo's musical process '[v]ery much almost an improv mentality' and has said that they 'try to have fun and write songs that we would want to listen to', adding that 'the whole idea of labeling genres is not super important to us'. Les became interested in making music as a teenager when she got her first guitar; she has said that she 'kind of always just wanted to be a songwriter' and 'love[s] anything with a catchy melody'. She has cited Naked City, Playboi Carti, 3OH!3, Cannibal Corpse, and various PC Music artists as influences.[8] She works at an empanada restaurant and studied acoustic engineering in college in Chicago.[6] She is openly transgender.</p><p>- Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Gecs\">Wikipedia</a></p>"

He became interested in music after being part of his high school choir and studied acoustic engineering in college for three years before moving to Los Angeles.[21] Brady has said 100 Gecs' style is influenced by Breathe Carolina, John Zorn, and I See Stars, among others. In 2019, Brady co-produced the song 'Click' from Charli XCX's album Charli (2019)—Charli XCX explained that she heard about Brady via her fans and 'listen[s] to [100 Gecs] constantly now'</p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Gecs\">Wikipedia</a></p>"
